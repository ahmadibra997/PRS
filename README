This is a very simple patient data management system developed for use in a
Charity Clinic in Delhi. It is written as an HTML5 application, and uses
Indexeddb as the underlying data store. As such this also serves as an
exercise in learning this nascent and fast-changing API.

Support for IndexedDB is not available in all browsers. You need the very
latest versions of Chrome or Firefox to have this work.

* Installation

  - Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome or Firefox installed on your
    system
    
  - Clone the repository

  - Point your browser to prs/prs.html
